TODO: Your job is to write the invariant for the GenericQueue class and the contracts for enqueue and dequeue.

A main method was provided for the purposes of primitive testing for Question 4, but there is nothing you need to do
for that class in terms of getting a grade. If you don't feel the need to do any kind of primitive testing, then ignore it.

Note that if you do end up wanting to run the main before you implement the 3 tests needed for question 4, you'll have
to comment out the @Test annotations in the TestGenericQueue file since those are throwing an error because they exist
without a corresponding test.

The Node class can also be ignored. It is only there to help with the implementation of the GenericQueue class.
