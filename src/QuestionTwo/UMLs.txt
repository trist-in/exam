TODO: Look at the UML diagram in this package. It corresponds with the GenericQueue.java file in the QuestionThree package.
    Identify 3 issue present within the UML diagram. Not only should you identify the issues, but you should also
    provide a solution to the issue.

Issue 1: The printQueue is not correctly formatted as a static function

Solution 1: Underline the function

Issue 2: size int is a private member, but denoted as public

Solution 2: Set the + next to size int as a - to denote as private.

Issue 3: genericQueue class declared as void

Solution 3: As constructors have no return type at all, none should be given. Should just be class name.
